# test-datasets: `dualrnaseq`
Test data to be used for automated testing with nf-core pipelines

This branch contains test data for the [nf-core/dualrnaseq](https://github.com/nf-core/dualrnaseq) pipeline.

## Test data

Paired end data was simulated using the R package [Polyester](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/polyester.html).

Data (3 samples) was simulated from the Human genome (Gencode v33) plus *Salmonella Typhimurium (SL1344)*

The corresponding subsets of genomes and annotation files can be found in the `references/` directory.
